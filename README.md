A minimal demonstration of breakpoints in an iOS app debugger. It can be used for function hooking, like a very lightweight Frida. Itâ€™s mainly for demonstration/learning purposes, the entire implementation is less than 200 lines of code. Works on arm64 simulator and device.

# Getting started

Create an instance of SimpleDebugger like so:

```c++
SimpleDebugger *debugger = new SimpleDebugger();
```

## Hook functions

Hook functions using the `hookFunction(void *originalFunc, void *newFunc)` method. The originalFunction must be at
least 5 instructions long, if not you will get undefined behavior.

After the hook is added all calls to originalFunc will go to newFunc. Make sure the signature for newFunc exactly
matches originalFunc. Once a hook is added it is active for the lifetime of the process. There is not a way to
call the original function from the hooked function.

## Set breakpoints

Set breakpoints using the `setBreakpoint(vm_address_t address)` method. The provided address must be in the __TEXT/__text section (the memory region containing executable code).

If you set breakpoints without calling `startDebugging` lldb can handle these breakpoints instead, although continuing past a breakpoint will not automatically work in lldb for breakpoints set by SimpleDebugger. You can manually increment the program counter in lldb to continue.

## Respond to breakpoints

Handle a breakpoint being hit using the `setExceptionCallback` method. The provided callback takes two parameters, one is the CPU state and the other is a function that can be called to continue execution on the thread that hit the breakpoint. Call `startDebugging` to begin receiving events.

## Example:

This example creates a debugger and adds one breakpoint.

```c++
#include <SimpleDebugger.h>

void myFunction() { printf("Hello world\n"); }

void breakpointCallback(arm_thread_state64_t state, std::function<void()> sendReply) {
    printf("Got breakpoint with PC: 0x%llx\n", state.__pc);
    sendReply();
}

__attribute__((constructor)) void example(void);
__attribute__((constructor)) void setup() {
  SimpleDebugger *debugger = new SimpleDebugger();
  debugger->setExceptionCallback(breakpointCallback);
  debugger->setBreakpoint((vm_address_t) &myFunction);
  // You must call start debugging to set up the exception server.
  debugger->startDebugging();

  // The breakpoint handler will run before myFunction
  myFunction();
}
```

This example hooks the `gettimeofday` function:

```c++
#include <SimpleDebugger.h>

SimpleDebugger *handler;

int gettimeofday_new(struct timeval *t, void *a) {
  t->tv_sec = 1723532400;
  t->tv_usec = 0;
  return 0;
}

void hookTime() {
  handler = new SimpleDebugger();
  handler->hookFunction((void *) &gettimeofday, (void *) &gettimeofday_new);
}
```

# How it works

SimpleDebugger overwrites instructions with a break instruction by modifying the vm protection of the memory address to be writeable. The original instruction is stored in a table and written back after the breakpoint is hit. Break instructions are handled with a mach exception server.
